title Blocked Player Taking a Turn

participant Active_Client
participant Server

Server -> Active_Client: playerTurn
note left
	All turns start with the server
	notifying the active client that
	it is their turn. This diagram
	shows a turn where the player is 
	blocked and cannot move.
end note

Active_Client -> Active_Client: validate suggestion
Active_Client -> Server: makeSuggestion
Server -> All_Clients: updateGameLog

Server -> Client_A : playerShowSelect
note right
	Client_A, Client_B, and Client_C 
	are all part of All_Clients,
	but are also shown separately here
	to show that only one client is
	queried to show a card at a time.
end note

Client_A -> Server: noCard
Server -> Client_B : playerShowSelect
note right
	This example shows what happens
	when all players do not have a card
	that can disprove the suggestion
end note
Client_B -> Server: noCard
Server -> Client_C : playerShowSelect
Client_C -> Server: noCard

Server -> Active_Client: noCard

note left
	Because no players had a card to
	show, the active player is notified
	so they can make an accusation or
	end their turn
end note

Active_Client -> Active_Client: find player in suggestion\nand update position
Active_Client -> Server: updatePlayerPosition

Active_Client -> Server: completeTurn
Server -> Client_A: playerTurn
note right
	The server notifies the next
	client that it is their turn,
	which for simplicity is Client_A
	in this example
end note
